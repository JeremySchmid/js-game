  ;; replace with a "key-processor" adding pressed (repeated?) and released keys to a/the queue used for the input, maybe with a time-tag for when it was done
  ;; input processing will need to be dependent on whether game is in realtime or turnbased mode -> needs to be done in the queue processing, not this callback function - processing should either be done in the update portion of the loop before the physics update or in a function before (update) - model-view-controller separation
  ;; view is the opengl stuff->translates physics data to onscreen stuff
  ;; model is the worlddata and physics rules/functions->updates the world
  ;; controller is the input stuff->translates the multiple possible input-types into the actions/flags/functions - what the model should do
